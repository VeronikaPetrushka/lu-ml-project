Project Title: 
Analyzing Global Happiness Through Data

Objective: 
Your task is to analyze a recently published dataset from the New York Times, focusing on global happiness. This dataset has been released without any accompanying narrative, providing you with a unique opportunity to craft a compelling story and offer valuable insights to an audience interested in international affairs.

Scope of Work:

Data Analysis: done
Examine the dataset to identify which countries or regions are the happiest.
Investigate the contributing factors to happiness.
Determine if any features within the dataset are highly correlated with happiness or with each other.
Explore potential causes for these correlations.

Comparative Analysis (for example) : done
Conduct a detailed analysis of a particular continent i.e. Europe, identifying any outliers in each category.
Compare the happiness levels of the United States with European nations.
Provide recommendations for a hypothetical scenario where a US citizen is considering moving to Europe, specifically to countries like Poland, Norway, or Italy. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of staying in the US versus moving to these European countries.

Visualization and Interpretation: done +-
Create multiple attractive visuals to present your findings in a digestible format.
Accompany each visual with a concise summary, highlighting any interesting observations and key takeaways.

Explaining Happiness: done
Aim to explain the factors that contribute to the happiness of a country, making it comprehensible for readers.

Statistical Analysis and Predictions:
Conduct robust statistical analysis and provide predictions using the dataset.
Develop a machine learning model to predict at least one of the following based on the dataset: happiness, health, or generosity. The choice is yours.

Deliverables:
A detailed report with your findings, visualizations, and summaries.
An explanation of your chosen machine learning model and its predictions.
Insights and recommendations based on your comparative analysis.
Note: Pay close attention to the quality of your statistical analysis, the clarity of your visualizations, and the depth of your insights. This project is an opportunity to showcase your ability to derive meaningful stories from data and present them in an engaging manner.
